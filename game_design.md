# Strategy Simulation Game Design

## Game Overview

### Title: StrategyMasters: The Smartphone Industry Challenge

### Concept
A multiplayer strategy simulation game where 5 teams compete as smartphone manufacturers in a dynamic market. Each team makes strategic decisions over 10 rounds (quarters) to maximize their company's performance based on market share, profitability, innovation, and sustainability metrics.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply strategic frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, Value Chain, etc.) to real business scenarios
- Understand the relationship between strategic choices and business outcomes
- Practice competitive analysis and strategic positioning
- Experience the trade-offs between short-term gains and long-term sustainability
- Develop decision-making skills under competitive pressure and limited information

## Industry Selection: Smartphone Manufacturing

### Rationale for Selection
1. **Familiarity**: Most participants have experience with smartphones, making the industry accessible
2. **Dynamic**: Fast-paced industry with constant innovation and competitive pressures
3. **Strategic Richness**: Encompasses multiple strategic concepts (differentiation vs. cost leadership, innovation cycles, etc.)
4. **Global Relevance**: International industry with diverse market segments and approaches
5. **Clear Value Chain**: Distinct activities from R&D to marketing that can be manipulated

### Industry Structure
